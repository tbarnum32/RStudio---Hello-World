This script is inspired by the book 'Time Series for Data Science'. I say 'inspired' because I do not follow everything they do in the book 
  and I also add some of my own things to test out. 

Anyway, when in RStudio, changes to the script need to be committed first, then they can be pushed to github. The push can occur from 
  either the version control tab or from the upper right corner of the commit window.
